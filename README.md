# tf-assoc-recall-interp-cs282-project
A final class project for COMPSCI 182/282A at UC Berkeley, done by Sultan Daniels, Ebonye Smith, Erix Xu, and Alan Zu.

Run black_box_preds.ipynb to generate the plots seen in the report.

Due to this repo being anonymized, some directory paths and notebooks might have bugs, as the directories are set on lab servers, which requires some of the collaborator's names to be revealed.
